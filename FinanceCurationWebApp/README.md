## How to use

### Clone repository

A clone is a copy of all the code on the master branch.
It is an exact replica of the code on github.

A branch is a slightly changed or modified section of code that meets different objectives.
Branches are not copies of each other but have same origin

Forks are local instantiations that let you make changes to someone elseâ€™s codebase.
They clone the repository under your profile such that it is linked and changes made to the fork can be compared or merged with the original repository over time.

## Installing Python Packages From a Requirements File
Now that our Python requirements file is all set up, let's take a look at how to install packages from it. To do this, we will use the pip package manager.

The pip utility is used to install, upgrade, and uninstall Python packages. It is also used to manage Python virtual environments and more.

To start, open up a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the directory of your Python project. Once you are there, type the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
